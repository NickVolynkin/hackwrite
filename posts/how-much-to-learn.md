I recently wrote that you don't need to attain a high-level of coding skill for learning to code to be useful. A technical writer can see substantial ROI from just learning [enough to be dangerous](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/).

Which raises (not begs!) the question: How much *is* enough? What topics should tech writers know? And how well should we know them?

The following is my own biased opinion and perspective, based solely on my own experience, with no empirical data to back it up.

## Comfortable at the Terminal

Tech writers should be *comfortable* at a Unix (GNU/Linux, Mac) Bash terminal.

### What constitutes "comfortable" at the terminal?

 - Basic facility with navigation and file manipulation commands (`cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`)
 - General understanding of how commands --- enough to quickly learn and use other tools you may need (`git`, `curl`, etc.)
 - Know how to open, edit, and close a file with `vi`
 - Lack of fear or anxiety, and the confidence to use Google or Stack Overflow to solve problems

It's great to know more, of course. Tools like `grep` can help you search code bases; understanding `awk` and other tools can help you with data munging and cleaning up text. Having some facility with bash scripting can help you automate various aspects of your job, making you happier and more productive.
