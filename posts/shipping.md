My New Year's Resolution --- which I have so far held to --- is to write *and publish* every day.

I have tendencies toward perfectionism. For me, this frequently manifests as inaction --- it can't be perfect, so I might as well not do it. Or, more often: It isn't perfect yet. I just need to work on it a little more.

Having a firm deadline every morning (roughly 7:00 AM) makes that sort of perfectionism nearly impossible.

I haven't decided yet if I will keep this up. I find that some of the posts I've published have not been as good as I would have liked (or, really, [made very mush sense at all](http://hackwrite.com/posts/data-structures-and-philosophy/)). [Seth Godin blogs every day.](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) I'm not sure that this is where I need to be.

But, for now, I need it.

I need to get myself into he habit of *shipping*. There is such a thing as a MVP, and I need to be a lot more comfortable hoe minimal that can be some times.

I also need the habit of producing first. I have a tendency to want to consume. This is sometimes lazy consumption (TV, movies, YouTube), but even when I'm trying to be productive and work on something, I have a tendency toward consumption first. Let me just read the whole book first, and watch a few tutorials, and ask a question on Stack Overflow...

One of the things I've learned as I have improved my [bad coding skills](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/) is that you really don't learn until you do it. Just put something down and see how it is.

So, for now, that's what I'm doing with this blog. If you are one of the handful of people who read it --- I would love your feedback. And I'm sorry if sometimes the posts don't make any sense or don't seem relevant or feel like they were thrown together in 45 minutes that morning (they were!).
