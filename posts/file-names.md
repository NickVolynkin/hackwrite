- Docs should only have a date if it is intrinsic to the content. Your 2017 budget should have "2017" in the title. Meeting minutes should have meeting date in the title.
- Docs that are not time bound shouldn't have the date in the title. If you have a photo release form or a PO request document, the creation date is irrelevant.
- Except for news and blog posts (and similar), *creation date* is usually irrelevant. Your 2017 budget should NOT specify in the file name that it was created in 2016.
- Version history should NOT EVER be inserted into the file name. Use version control, not multiple renamed copies of files.
- Uniqueness should be a function of URI, not file name. (See Berners-Lee, "Cool URIs" for more on this.)
- File names should use hyphens, not underscores. They should also have no spaces, no special characters, and be lowercase only.
- Dates, if needed, should be either at the beginning or the end of the name, depending largely on how heaps of files will likely be organized and sorted.
- Dates should be YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD. Always include leading zeros. Do not run the date together (20170119).
- Prefer web URIs to emailed documents. If you are disseminating info, put on a page with a unique URI. Only use PDF if there is a strong need for the recipient to actually physically print the document.
