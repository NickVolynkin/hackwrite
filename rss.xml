&lt;p&gt;But often, bad programming is a result of bad philosophy - a fundamental misunderstanding of how meaning is made, or thought works, or how the world is structured. Sometimes the fault is a little less radical, tied to ignorance of some domain-specific facts, but often it's just plain bad philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nowhere is bad philosophy more on display than in poorly designed data models. Most &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A376BB2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00A376BB2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=musforsun-20"&gt;database 'antipatterns'&lt;/a&gt; are philosophical in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, not well understood by the majority of programmers and project managers. Even most engineers (read: technicians) who do things the right way can't always explain the philosophical underpinnings of the right way. This situation is analogous to high school students who know how to use the quadratic formula, but have no idea why it's meaningful. But while most of those bored teenagers move blissfully away from mathematics without doing anyone any serious harm, programmers without a sense of good philosophy (along with plenty of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517122707/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0517122707&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=musforsun-20"&gt;theology and geometry&lt;/a&gt;) move from project to project, wreaking havoc on database after database without any understanding of why things keep breaking. This situation is, of course, compounded by project managers, executives, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O8101E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B007O8101E&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=musforsun-20"&gt;pointy-haired bosses&lt;/a&gt; of all stripes who don't rise to the level of software technician, and so don't even know what the right way is, let alone understand why there has to be a right way in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Canonical Example: How Old Are You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you are aware that the correct piece of information to store about a person is not their age, but their birthday. Other than the fact that this is painfully obvious to anyone who thinks about it for more than a moment, what might we offer as a philosophical explanation of the right way, and how can we understand why so many people take the wrong path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are forced to "show our work," there are at least two routes by which one can arrive at the "store birthdays, not ages."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding of Human Thought&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more obvious, and slightly less interesting, of the two routes involves an understanding of what a person does when asked the question, "How old are you?" or "How old is Socrates?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Socrates is, of course, either the interviewee's child or pet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, we do not walk around with the answer to this question readily available. Rather, we quickly calculate it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Let's see, I was born in 1982 and... what year is it? Oh right, so I'm... 34, I guess? Yeah - 34. I'll be 35 in July."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working backwards from "how do I figure it out" we can arrive at "how should it be known."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Knowledge: Thomistic Data Structures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do the inverse, work forwards from the more fundamental question --- how is a thing known?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your database is supposed to know everything, and always be right. But facts change. How can this be handled?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medieval philosophers had a similar, but much more fundamental question:
God knows everything, and is always right. Facts change. &lt;strong&gt;But God cannot change.&lt;/strong&gt; How can God know about things if God doesn't change, but things do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether the knowledge of God is variable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objection 1:&lt;br&gt;
It seems that the knowledge of God is variable. For knowledge is related to what is knowable. But whatever imports relation to the creature is applied to God from time, and varies according to the variation of creatures. Therefore the knowledge of God is variable according to the variation of creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--- &lt;a href="http://home.newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm#article15"&gt;Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Pars Prima - Question 14, Article 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem silly, but it was a big deal at the time: If God's knowledge is variable, than God is variable. But God &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; variable --- God is Simple, and One. The whole edifice of belief might crumble if we imagine a God who just changes willy-nilly. (Not unlike a computer system that crashes from too many logical contradictions and inconsistencies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, like the issue of storing birthdays or ages, the question only seems silly now because an answer was provided which is so obvious and clear that once you have grokked it, you will wonder why you didn't think of it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The following is Aquinas' reply to a later objection, but it is particularly relevant here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Nominalists said that it was the same thing to say "Christ is born" and "will be born" and "was born"; because the same thing is signified by these three--viz. the nativity of Christ. Therefore it follows, they said, that whatever God knew, He knows; because now He knows that Christ is born, which means the same thing as that Christ will be born. This opinion, however, is false; both because the diversity in the parts of a sentence causes a diversity of enunciations; and because it would follow that a proposition which is true once would be always true; which is contrary to what the Philosopher lays down (Categor. iii) when he says that this sentence, "Socrates sits," is true when he is sitting, and false when he rises up. Therefore, it must be conceded that this proposition is not true, "Whatever God knew He knows," if referred to enunciable propositions. But because of this, it does not follow that the knowledge of God is variable. For as it is without variation in the divine knowledge that God knows one and the same thing sometime to be, and sometime not to be, so it is without variation in the divine knowledge that God knows an enunciable proposition is sometime true, and sometime false. The knowledge of God, however, would be variable if He knew enunciable things by way of enunciation, by composition and division, as occurs in our intellect. Hence our knowledge varies either as regards truth and falsity, for example, if when either as regards truth and falsity, for example, if when a thing suffers change we retained the same opinion about it; or as regards diverse opinions, as if we first thought that anyone was sitting, and afterwards thought that he was not sitting; neither of which can be in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquinas is explaining that some thing which is only true at a point in time is not known by God by way of the kind of knowledge expressed in present-tense statements, like "Socrates is sitting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely analogous to our database, where enunciating the individual facts "today I am 34; tomorrow I will be 35" is not proper to the way a database knows things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Persistence vs. Application Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I think we have an analogy to the separation of concerns between a &lt;em&gt;Single Source of Truth&lt;/em&gt; database and the application layer. The database doesn't "know" things by way of enunciation --- it simply knows things. It is up to the (human?) logic of the application layer to enunciate that knowledge for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imperfect Analogies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is an imperfect analogy, since &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; exist. (That is, the contents of the database change.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our database is in no way omniscient (unless you work for Google), but there is a benefit to patterning knowledge using the highest form of rational thinking possible. With the birthday example, we can look to a Divine Precedent for our data model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One can be an atheist or agnostic and still benefit from this analogy by asking the question as a hypothetical: How &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; an omniscient, unmoving God know things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note --- having this Divine Precedent probably explains my aesthetic revulsion at &lt;a href="http://blog.mlab.com/2012/08/why-is-mongodb-wildly-popular/#comment-353"&gt;NoSQL's propensity to float data integrity concerns into the application layer&lt;/a&gt;. (I'm not sure if this means that NoSQL people are Godless heathens or just &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theology"&gt;process theologians&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Models of Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that philosophy, or at least philosophical thinking, can inform system design. The application of epistemology (how we know things) should be of particular interest to the design of knowledge systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example is choice of database. Instead of following the New Hotness (or the "I've always done it this way"), what if we had an epistemological approach to selecting a particular database engine? What if, before asking "how this should information be stored?" we asked "How is this knowledge known?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime, the knowledge will be known in an Aristotelian (or Medieval Scholastic) way, in which case traditional SQL (or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717189800306"&gt;something even more on the nose&lt;/a&gt;) might be the right approach. Other times, we'll have to look to human reason. Other times, some other way of knowing and organizing the world. (So maybe those Mongo people are on to &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/data-structures-and-philosophy/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 15:26:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On the Design of this Blog</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/on-the-design-of-this-blog/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Since I spend almost my entire day in an editor, writing, I've put a bit of effort into getting it to look the way I like. The most important things for my writing experience are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dark theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oversized display font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively narrow text (&amp;lt; 80 column)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;centered text with a decent margin on each side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my screen looks like when writing a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AMW Post in Editor" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-post-in-editor.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reduces eye fatigue, lets me focus on the writing, and generally speeds me up while making me happier. It doesn't hurt that my non-tech friends see this screen and think I'm some kind of mad hacker scientist, while my developer colleagues see it and know I use (some of) the same tools they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally made the switch to this writing environment, over WordPress Visual Editor or MS Word, I had a sort of writer's euphoria. After several years, it still hasn't really gone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AMW Raving About Sublime on FB" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-fb-sublime-raving.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I use &lt;a href="http://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; now, instead of Sublime, but the point is the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really do prefer reading content this way --- sometimes if I have to read a really long text I'll copy-paste into Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I thought --- wouldn't it be cool if my site looked like that? It took a lot of work but, it (currently, as I am writing this) does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hack.write's Editor Theme" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-hackwrite-atom-theme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm including the picture for reference, because I'll probably be changing this theme soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the writer and reader experiences are quite different. For one thing, I've several people tell me they thought it was supposed to look like a Terminal, as opposed to a Code Editor. This is sort of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, more to the point, it seems off-putting to non-tech people. And even some tech people, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked a lot of people for feedback --- most of the positive comments have been along the lines of "I like the idea" or "cool concept." That's very different than, "it was a joy to read." In fact, I don't think anyone has said anything indicating that they had a positive experience &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; the blog with the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was broken for a couple days earlier this week, looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hack.write broken" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/hw-base-theme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this doesn't look like an editor, obviously --- it strikes me that this might be a little more in the realm of the developer aesthetic. It's clean, basic. Narrow columns, plenty of space. Nearly neutral, focused on content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to play around with variations here, and see if I can find a way to get back to a more readable design while retaining some of the more memorable elements of my in-editor theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/on-the-design-of-this-blog/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 14:29:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Overriding CSS/LESS Declaration to Reduce One LOC</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the theme for &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, I was referencing &lt;a href="http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/"&gt;Markdown CSS&lt;/a&gt;, which makes HTML look like Markdown. (h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericholscher"&gt;@ericholscher&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/mrcoles/markdown-css/blob/master/markdown.less"&gt;ran across an interesting (let's call it a) pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"## "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; for all five subheadings is first set to &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;, and then re-defined individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This saves, as far as I can figure out, one line of code. (Well, two lines if you count the closing curly brace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"## "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second way --- one extra line of verbosity --- strikes me as more readable, easier to understand immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first way isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; obscure, just a touch clever. It doesn't impede readability so much as provide a little brain hiccup. If I weren't writing about it, it would have cost me nothing more than a brief moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me wonder. We generally place a premium on code readability. "Don't be clever" is common --- and good --- advice. But if code is poetry (or, at least, art), maybe these little flourishes --- when they don't impede readability, really --- add to the beauty of the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 13:50:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Overriding CSS/LESS Declaration to Reduce One LOC</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the theme for &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, I was referencing &lt;a href="http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/"&gt;Markdown CSS&lt;/a&gt;, which makes HTML look like Markdown.

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; for all five subheadings is first set to &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;, and then re-defined individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This saves, as far as I can figure out, one line of code. (Well, two lines if you count the closing curly brace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"## "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second way --- one extra line of verbosity --- strikes me as more readable, easier to understand immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first way isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; obscure, just a touch clever. It doesn't impede readability so much as provide a little brain hiccup. If I weren't writing about it, it would have cost me nothing more than a brief moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me wonder. We generally place a premium on code readability. "Don't be clever" is common --- and good --- advice. But if code is poetry (or, at least, art), maybe these little flourishes --- when they don't impede readability, really --- add to the beauty of the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 13:50:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>It Should Matter That It's You</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/it-should-matter-that-its-you/it-should-matter-that-its-you/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up doing theatre, went to college for theatre, and taught theatre for a few years. Nearly all of my theatre experience --- as a performer, teacher, director, stagehand, designer, or even audience member --- was non-profit and the bulk was non-professional. High school, university, community, non-profit regional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of shows where it didn't seem to matter who had directed it, or who had designed it. So many high school and community theatre shows are bad reproductions of the professional version of the same show. Musicals, comedies, murder mysteries... musical comedy murder mysteries. Names the audience recognizes, with poorly built sets that look pretty much the same as every other production of the show, and costumes assembled from what seems like the same pile of thrift-store refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major license holders that lease titles to amateur and non-profit theatres make this boring situation even worse by selling convenient production packages. You can rent costumes, props, and scenery along with performer scripts and orchestral scores. Everything shows up in a bunch of boxes, you pull your show out, and ship everything back when you are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems here. It leads to boring theatre; it devalues the talent of individual contributors; it promotes the idea that culture and art come from some other place and even passionate amateurs are really just consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;inside the box&lt;/em&gt; approach teaches everyone involved that there is &lt;strong&gt;one right way&lt;/strong&gt; of doing things. And that gives the impression that outcomes exist on a one-dimensional scale of quality: it was either a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; version of the same thing, or a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; version. (One might say, a &lt;em&gt;good copy&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;bad copy&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the number of things that can affect the one-dimensional rating is pretty small. With school shows, its usually money --- schools with rich parents do a better copy than schools with poor parents. It also might mean talent --- better dancers doing the same moves, a better school band playing the score, a better actor playing the lead. (This is mostly money, too --- but at least it's slightly indirect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-dimensional scale affects how audiences perceive the work. The most common compliment you will ever hear from audience members in an amateur setting is, "It was so professional." If the complimenter is an arts fan, this will be followed by a comparison between the present production and some other "real" production (yes, that word gets used), and how this one was "just as good."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't just as good, of course. One wonders --- why not just stay home and watch the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also affects the way people talk about career trajectory. As a teenager doing theatre, I was constantly told about New York. Someone saw a show in New York and thought of me. I should move to New York when I grow up. That director is really good... did you hear? He's from New York. This is the way they do it in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local, Specific&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had any interest in this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because I was never any good at copying. My attempts in that vein were always quite low on the one-dimensional quality scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wasn't interested in making a copy of someone else's production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When other theatre kids were listening to cast recordings and looking at coffee-table books about Broadway, I was reading &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hNFHI3"&gt;Brook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iv7VGq"&gt;Artaud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iEcDCq"&gt;Mamet&lt;/a&gt;. When everyone else was dreaming about New York, I dreamed about a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2j0y7WH"&gt;Living Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hO8jz7"&gt;Poor Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hO886M"&gt;Holy Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create something that was specific. Something local. Something that could only be created there, that time. Not just my vision as a director or designer --- though, yes, that too. But the synthesis of everyone's vision. This particular team, in this particular space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting books on theatre I've ever read was an account of a tour by Peter Brook's company. (It &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iEucSJ"&gt;The Open Circle&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm not sure.) The book detailed how they adapted each venue they performed in, and how the show itself adapted to each new location. The same actors, the same production, was different each place they performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a change in building matters that much, how can it make any sense that a thousand productions with different casts and different directors, in different cities, should all look so much alike?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Just Theatre, Not Just Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I've done any theatre, but I continue to be bad at making copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sold insurance, I developed my own pitch. When I was a church choir director, our repertoire and programming wasn't the same as anyone else's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm hardly unique in this desire to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of church music, &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/"&gt;my current parish&lt;/a&gt; has perhaps the oddest assemblage of musical variety I've ever encountered in a single worshipping community. There's &lt;a href="https://www.classicalsinger.com/sites/showsite.php?pt=1&amp;amp;user_id=30842"&gt;a professionally trained opera singer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://anglobaptist.org/"&gt;banjo-playing early music specialist&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/worship-music-and-the-arts/music/angel-band/"&gt;bluegrass band&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/worship-music-and-the-arts/music/hearts-on-fire-gospel-choir/"&gt;gospel choir&lt;/a&gt;, and a pipe organ. On any given Sunday you might hear a Bach chorale, some Gregorian chant, a contemporary Gospel number, your grandmother's favorite hymn, and a Johny Cash song. It's weird, and it doesn't always work. But it's unlike any other place. And even though it would drive some people crazy, there are a bunch of us who can't really imagine being anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that you can be &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt; at something? I mean really --- in the top 1% of any particular skill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the best writer. I'm &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/"&gt;certainly not the best coder&lt;/a&gt;. Not the best project manager. Not the one best, and probably not even one of the best, in any of the individual skills needed to have a career as a Technical Writer. But my career has taken off since I have focused on answering two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my unique combination of skills?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my particular approach to technical writing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up trying to be &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt;, and have focused on being myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify that I don't especially try to be different. I don't go out of my way to find out what other tech writers are doing and then do things differently. I think each one of us is different naturally. We have particular experiences, preferences, interests. Some of these differences are big (work experience, degrees), and some are minor (favorite editor) --- but each of us is particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the particular, and the right opportunities find you. And just as importantly --- focus on the particular, and the wrong opportunities avoid you like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever told someone in an initial interview what technologies you like to work with and which ones you don't want to have anything to do with? Or told them what you love &lt;em&gt;and hate&lt;/em&gt; about doing this job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a bad fit for a job, you find out right away. And if you're a good fit, you find that out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you weird? What do you like that everyone else thinks is silly? What does everyone do the same that you absolutely hate? How is your writing different than anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideas here are mine, but not mine alone. You may also appeciate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# variable not assigned&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# input, assignment, validation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the assignment or validation fails, the loop repeats and the user has another opportunity to enter input. (You could even add a message to &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; if you wanted to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came up for me in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/adammichaelwood/6f2e02c4156c6cc27020ce179d2e8638"&gt;a little script I wrote&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/56r94z/what_python_program_have_you_created_to_make_your/d8m0hy6/?context=3"&gt;semi-automate a task&lt;/a&gt;. I needed to rate the quality of something I was looking at, and I was going for speed: Glance at the item, make a snap quality judgment, type a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, sometimes I typed the number incorrectly, hitting a letter instead of a number. This screwed things up latter, when I tried to order all my items by quality rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I cast the input to an integer inside the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and used the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to repeat until the &lt;code&gt;quality&lt;/code&gt; rating was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quality'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;lnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quality'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Quality (0-9): "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This approach could be expanded for more complicated types of validation, and messages to the user could be added.

&lt;/pre&gt;

I don't see any sign that the trend is dying down any time soon. I might as well jump on the bandwagon here and encourage my fellow tech writers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a lot of you already code, or are in the process of learning. I once assumed knowing at least some coding was a requirement for being a tech writer. But it seems this isn't entirely the case. Some TWs need to be able to read and write enough code to document APIs and provide code samples --- but apparently (I have learned) most tech writers aren't doing that, and you can fake your way through that if you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;if you are among the majority of technical writers that don't code, this post is for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Know Too Much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people outside the tech field suddenly decide that they are going to learn to code, they have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how hard that actually is. All of the "Learn to Code" resources, books, sites, and bootcamps tell you that you can learn to build web and mobile apps pretty easily --- in just a few weeks, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you first start coding, it seems magical. Especially if the framework does a lot for you. "Oh, wow! Is this all it takes to build an app?!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I know --- these people don't have any idea what they are in for, how difficult it is about to get for them, how far is the distance between local build and production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this stops many of us from getting started. It stopped me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beginner's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner's mind is a state in which, lacking the knowledge of how hard something is, everything seems easy. There are no boundaries, only possibilities. Beginner's mind is crucial for early learning of a new skill or subject area. With beginner's mind, small improvements seem like major wins. This enthusiasm creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging more learning and skill acquisition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech writers don't have beginner's mind. Even if you have never written a line of code in your life, our proximity to software development has shattered any illusions we might have about how easy it is to get an app built and launched. We are aware of all the things that beginners happily ignore --- security, maintainability, deployment, cross-platform compatibility. We've seen too many problems caused by ignoring things. If we ever do sit down to start building a little app or follow along with a tutorial, we are overwhelmed by all the things that are going unmentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I'm the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Hope to be a Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my trick for overcoming this problem --- drastically lower your expectations of what "learning to code" means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know how hard it is to go from zero (or even 1) to actually-qualified developer. And you've met too many not-actually-qualified developers to have any interest in that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By deciding you are not ever going to write any application code. You are not going to be a developer. You are not even going to be a "coder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to be a &lt;em&gt;technical writer with bad coding skills&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lowers the bar, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Coding Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you going to do with bad coding skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not going to become a developer with bad coding skills. (That's not an editorial "you." Lots of people become developers with bad coding skills. You, in particular, are not going to become a developer with bad coding skills.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to be a better technical writer. More efficient, happier, and more employable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a few things I have been able to do since acquiring bad coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;semi-automate an incredibly boring freelance writing task, letting me earn the same amount of money in about half the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily render HTML from Markdown, automating fussy style rules and naming conventions, saving several minutes and annoyance every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch from WordPress to Jekyll and/or Nikola for my personal blogs, saving money and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put "Python" on my resume, greatly increasing the number of interviews and job opportunities I get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automate documentation deployment ("DocOps")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write code samples where I actually knew what was going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a code contribution to an Open Source project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not built any apps or launched any products. No one has ever paid me to write code, and I don't think anyone ever will. I don't know how to handle user sessions or deal with cache invalidation. I code slowly, and I Google constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, believe me, the code I have written is bad. It's ugly and inefficient. It wouldn't pass a code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, even though my coding skills are bad, they have made a huge impact in my life. I am more employable, more efficient, more valuable. I'm also happier, and &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com/posts/third-option-success/"&gt;feel more optimistic about my future&lt;/a&gt;. Bad code works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been discouraged, I encourage you. It only takes a little bit --- enough to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How (What) To Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is the perfect language for bad coding by non-developers. You can do a lot without knowing very much, and there are a lot of tools for accomplishing non-development tasks --- writing tools, math tools, publishing tools, task automation tools. If you're going to learn to code in order to improve your own life (as opposed to learning to code to get a job or build things) Python is the best option. (It's also good for getting jobs and building things. Learning Python will not limit you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not recommend &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iwhe9n"&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is very popular. It's out of date and a bit too curmudgeonly.&lt;/p&gt;
