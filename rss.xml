The most important things for my writing experience are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dark theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oversized display font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively narrow text (&amp;lt; 80 column)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;centered text with a decent margin on each side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my screen looks like when writing a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AMW Post in Editor" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-post-in-editor.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reduces eye fatigue, lets me focus on the writing, and generally speeds me up while making me happier. It doesn't hurt that my non-tech friends see this screen and think I'm some kind of mad hacker scientist, while my developer colleagues see it and know I use (some of) the same tools they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally made the switch to this writing environment, over WordPress Visual Editor or MS Word, I had a sort of writer's euphoria. After several years, it still hasn't really gone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AMW Raving About Sublime on FB" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-fb-sublime-raving.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I use &lt;a href="http://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; now, instead of Sublime, but the point is the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really do prefer reading content this way --- sometimes if I have to read a really long text I'll copy-paste into Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I thought --- wouldn't it be cool if my site looked like that? It took a lot of work but, it (currently, as I am writing this) does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hack.write's Editor Theme" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/amw-hackwrite-atom-theme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm including the picture for reference, because I'll probably be changing this theme soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the writer and reader experiences are quite different. For one thing, I've several people tell me they thought it was supposed to look like a Terminal, as opposed to a Code Editor. This is sort of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, more to the point, it seems off-putting to non-tech people. And even some tech people, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked a lot of people for feedback --- most of the positive comments have been along the lines of "I like the idea" or "cool concept." That's very different than, "it was a joy to read." In fact, I don't think anyone has said anything indicating that they had a positive experience &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; the blog with the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was broken for a couple days earlier this week, looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hack.write broken" src="http://hackwrite.com/img/hw-base-theme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this doesn't look like an editor, obviously --- it strikes me that this might be a little more in the realm of the developer aesthetic. It's clean, basic. Narrow columns, plenty of space. Nearly neutral, focused on content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to play around with variations here, and see if I can find a way to get back to a more readable design while retaining some of the more memorable elements of my in-editor theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/on-the-design-of-this-blog/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 14:29:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Overriding CSS/LESS Declaration to Reduce One LOC</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the theme for &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, I was referencing &lt;a href="http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/"&gt;Markdown CSS&lt;/a&gt;, which makes HTML look like Markdown. (h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericholscher"&gt;@ericholscher&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/mrcoles/markdown-css/blob/master/markdown.less"&gt;ran across an interesting (let's call it a) pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"## "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; for all five subheadings is first set to &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;, and then re-defined individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This saves, as far as I can figure out, one line of code. (Well, two lines if you count the closing curly brace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"## "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"##### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"###### "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second way --- one extra line of verbosity --- strikes me as more readable, easier to understand immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first way isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; obscure, just a touch clever. It doesn't impede readability so much as provide a little brain hiccup. If I weren't writing about it, it would have cost me nothing more than a brief moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me wonder. We generally place a premium on code readability. "Don't be clever" is common --- and good --- advice. But if code is poetry (or, at least, art), maybe these little flourishes --- when they don't impede readability, really --- add to the beauty of the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 13:50:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Overriding CSS/LESS Declaration to Reduce One LOC</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/overriding-css-declaration-to-reduce-loc/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the theme for &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, I was referencing &lt;a href="http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/"&gt;Markdown CSS&lt;/a&gt;, which makes HTML look like Markdown.

Nearly all of my theatre experience --- as a performer, teacher, director, stagehand, designer, or even audience member --- was non-profit and the bulk was non-professional. High school, university, community, non-profit regional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of shows where it didn't seem to matter who had directed it, or who had designed it. So many high school and community theatre shows are bad reproductions of the professional version of the same show. Musicals, comedies, murder mysteries... musical comedy murder mysteries. Names the audience recognizes, with poorly built sets that look pretty much the same as every other production of the show, and costumes assembled from what seems like the same pile of thrift-store refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major license holders that lease titles to amateur and non-profit theatres make this boring situation even worse by selling convenient production packages. You can rent costumes, props, and scenery along with performer scripts and orchestral scores. Everything shows up in a bunch of boxes, you pull your show out, and ship everything back when you are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems here. It leads to boring theatre; it devalues the talent of individual contributors; it promotes the idea that culture and art come from some other place and even passionate amateurs are really just consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;inside the box&lt;/em&gt; approach teaches everyone involved that there is &lt;strong&gt;one right way&lt;/strong&gt; of doing things. And that gives the impression that outcomes exist on a one-dimensional scale of quality: it was either a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; version of the same thing, or a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; version. (One might say, a &lt;em&gt;good copy&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;bad copy&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the number of things that can affect the one-dimensional rating is pretty small. With school shows, its usually money --- schools with rich parents do a better copy than schools with poor parents. It also might mean talent --- better dancers doing the same moves, a better school band playing the score, a better actor playing the lead. (This is mostly money, too --- but at least it's slightly indirect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-dimensional scale affects how audiences perceive the work. The most common compliment you will ever hear from audience members in an amateur setting is, "It was so professional." If the complimenter is an arts fan, this will be followed by a comparison between the present production and some other "real" production (yes, that word gets used), and how this one was "just as good."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't just as good, of course. One wonders --- why not just stay home and watch the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also affects the way people talk about career trajectory. As a teenager doing theatre, I was constantly told about New York. Someone saw a show in New York and thought of me. I should move to New York when I grow up. That director is really good... did you hear? He's from New York. This is the way they do it in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local, Specific&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had any interest in this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because I was never any good at copying. My attempts in that vein were always quite low on the one-dimensional quality scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wasn't interested in making a copy of someone else's production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When other theatre kids were listening to cast recordings and looking at coffee-table books about Broadway, I was reading &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hNFHI3"&gt;Brook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iv7VGq"&gt;Artaud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iEcDCq"&gt;Mamet&lt;/a&gt;. When everyone else was dreaming about New York, I dreamed about a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2j0y7WH"&gt;Living Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hO8jz7"&gt;Poor Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hO886M"&gt;Holy Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create something that was specific. Something local. Something that could only be created there, that time. Not just my vision as a director or designer --- though, yes, that too. But the synthesis of everyone's vision. This particular team, in this particular space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting books on theatre I've ever read was an account of a tour by Peter Brook's company. (It &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iEucSJ"&gt;The Open Circle&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm not sure.) The book detailed how they adapted each venue they performed in, and how the show itself adapted to each new location. The same actors, the same production, was different each place they performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a change in building matters that much, how can it make any sense that a thousand productions with different casts and different directors, in different cities, should all look so much alike?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Just Theatre, Not Just Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I've done any theatre, but I continue to be bad at making copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sold insurance, I developed my own pitch. When I was a church choir director, our repertoire and programming wasn't the same as anyone else's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm hardly unique in this desire to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of church music, &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/"&gt;my current parish&lt;/a&gt; has perhaps the oddest assemblage of musical variety I've ever encountered in a single worshipping community. There's &lt;a href="https://www.classicalsinger.com/sites/showsite.php?pt=1&amp;amp;user_id=30842"&gt;a professionally trained opera singer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://anglobaptist.org/"&gt;banjo-playing early music specialist&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/worship-music-and-the-arts/music/angel-band/"&gt;bluegrass band&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.allsoulsparish.org/worship-music-and-the-arts/music/hearts-on-fire-gospel-choir/"&gt;gospel choir&lt;/a&gt;, and a pipe organ. On any given Sunday you might hear a Bach chorale, some Gregorian chant, a contemporary Gospel number, your grandmother's favorite hymn, and a Johny Cash song. It's weird, and it doesn't always work. But it's unlike any other place. And even though it would drive some people crazy, there are a bunch of us who can't really imagine being anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that you can be &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt; at something? I mean really --- in the top 1% of any particular skill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the best writer. I'm &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/"&gt;certainly not the best coder&lt;/a&gt;. Not the best project manager. Not the one best, and probably not even one of the best, in any of the individual skills needed to have a career as a Technical Writer. But my career has taken off since I have focused on answering two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my unique combination of skills?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my particular approach to technical writing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up trying to be &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt;, and have focused on being myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify that I don't especially try to be different. I don't go out of my way to find out what other tech writers are doing and then do things differently. I think each one of us is different naturally. We have particular experiences, preferences, interests. Some of these differences are big (work experience, degrees), and some are minor (favorite editor) --- but each of us is particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the particular, and the right opportunities find you. And just as importantly --- focus on the particular, and the wrong opportunities avoid you like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever told someone in an initial interview what technologies you like to work with and which ones you don't want to have anything to do with? Or told them what you love &lt;em&gt;and hate&lt;/em&gt; about doing this job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a bad fit for a job, you find out right away. And if you're a good fit, you find that out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you weird? What do you like that everyone else thinks is silly? What does everyone do the same that you absolutely hate? How is your writing different than anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Nearly all of my theatre experience --- as a performer, teacher, director, stagehand, designer, or even audience member --- was non-profit and the bulk was non-professional. High school, university, community, non-profit regional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of shows where it didn't seem to matter who had directed it, or who had designed it. So many high school and community theatre shows are bad reproductions of the professional version of the same show. Musicals, comedies, murder mysteries... musical comedy murder mysteries. Names the audience recognizes, with poorly built sets that look pretty much the same as every other production of the show, and costumes assembled from what seems like the same pile of thrift-store refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major license holders that lease titles to amateur and non-profit theatres make this boring situation even worse by selling convenient production packages. You can rent costumes, props, and scenery along with performer scripts and orchestral scores. Everything shows up in a bunch of boxes, you pull your show out, and ship everything back when you are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems here. It leads to boring theatre; it devalues the talent of individual contributors; it promotes the idea that culture and art come from some other place and even passionate amateurs are really just consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;inside the box&lt;/em&gt; approach teaches everyone involved that there is &lt;strong&gt;one right way&lt;/strong&gt; of doing things. And that gives the impression that outcomes exist on a one-dimensional scale of quality: it was either a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; version of the same thing, or a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; version. (One might say, a &lt;em&gt;good copy&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;bad copy&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the number of things that can affect the one-dimensional rating is pretty small. With school shows, its usually money --- schools with rich parents do a better copy than schools with poor parents. It also might mean talent --- better dancers doing the same moves, a better school band playing the score, a better actor playing the lead. (This is mostly money, too --- but at least it's slightly indirect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-dimensional scale affects how audiences perceive the work. The most common compliment you will ever hear from audience members in an amateur setting is, "It was so professional." If the complimenter is an arts fan, this will be followed by a comparison between the present production and some other "real" production (yes, that word gets used), and how this one was "just as good."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't just as good, of course. One wonders --- why not just stay home and watch the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also affects the way people talk about career trajectory. As a teenager doing theatre, I was constantly told about New York. Someone saw a show in New York and thought of me. I should move to New York when I grow up. That director is really good... did you hear? He's from New York. This is the way they do it in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local, Specific&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had any interest in this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because I was never any good at copying. My attempts in that vein were always quite low on the one-dimensional quality scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wasn't interested in making a copy of someone else's production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# variable not assigned&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the assignment or validation fails, the loop repeats and the user has another opportunity to enter input. (You could even add a message to &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; if you wanted to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came up for me in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/adammichaelwood/6f2e02c4156c6cc27020ce179d2e8638"&gt;a little script I wrote&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/56r94z/what_python_program_have_you_created_to_make_your/d8m0hy6/?context=3"&gt;semi-automate a task&lt;/a&gt;. I needed to rate the quality of something I was looking at, and I was going for speed: Glance at the item, make a snap quality judgment, type a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, sometimes I typed the number incorrectly, hitting a letter instead of a number. This screwed things up latter, when I tried to order all my items by quality rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I cast the input to an integer inside the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and used the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to repeat until the &lt;code&gt;quality&lt;/code&gt; rating was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quality'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

I don't see any sign that the trend is dying down any time soon. I might as well jump on the bandwagon here and encourage my fellow tech writers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a lot of you already code, or are in the process of learning. I once assumed knowing at least some coding was a requirement for being a tech writer. But it seems this isn't entirely the case. Some TWs need to be able to read and write enough code to document APIs and provide code samples --- but apparently (I have learned) most tech writers aren't doing that, and you can fake your way through that if you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;if you are among the majority of technical writers that don't code, this post is for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Know Too Much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people outside the tech field suddenly decide that they are going to learn to code, they have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how hard that actually is. All of the "Learn to Code" resources, books, sites, and bootcamps tell you that you can learn to build web and mobile apps pretty easily --- in just a few weeks, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you first start coding, it seems magical. Especially if the framework does a lot for you. "Oh, wow! Is this all it takes to build an app?!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I know --- these people don't have any idea what they are in for, how difficult it is about to get for them, how far is the distance between local build and production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this stops many of us from getting started. It stopped me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beginner's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner's mind is a state in which, lacking the knowledge of how hard something is, everything seems easy. There are no boundaries, only possibilities. Beginner's mind is crucial for early learning of a new skill or subject area. With beginner's mind, small improvements seem like major wins. This enthusiasm creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging more learning and skill acquisition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech writers don't have beginner's mind. Even if you have never written a line of code in your life, our proximity to software development has shattered any illusions we might have about how easy it is to get an app built and launched. We are aware of all the things that beginners happily ignore --- security, maintainability, deployment, cross-platform compatibility. We've seen too many problems caused by ignoring things. If we ever do sit down to start building a little app or follow along with a tutorial, we are overwhelmed by all the things that are going unmentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I'm the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Hope to be a Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my trick for overcoming this problem --- drastically lower your expectations of what "learning to code" means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know how hard it is to go from zero (or even 1) to actually-qualified developer. And you've met too many not-actually-qualified developers to have any interest in that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By deciding you are not ever going to write any application code. You are not going to be a developer. You are not even going to be a "coder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to be a &lt;em&gt;technical writer with bad coding skills&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lowers the bar, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Coding Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you going to do with bad coding skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not going to become a developer with bad coding skills. (That's not an editorial "you." Lots of people become developers with bad coding skills. You, in particular, are not going to become a developer with bad coding skills.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to be a better technical writer. More efficient, happier, and more employable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a few things I have been able to do since acquiring bad coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;semi-automate an incredibly boring freelance writing task, letting me earn the same amount of money in about half the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily render HTML from Markdown, automating fussy style rules and naming conventions, saving several minutes and annoyance every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch from WordPress to Jekyll and/or Nikola for my personal blogs, saving money and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put "Python" on my resume, greatly increasing the number of interviews and job opportunities I get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automate documentation deployment ("DocOps")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write code samples where I actually knew what was going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a code contribution to an Open Source project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not built any apps or launched any products. No one has ever paid me to write code, and I don't think anyone ever will. I don't know how to handle user sessions or deal with cache invalidation. I code slowly, and I Google constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, believe me, the code I have written is bad. It's ugly and inefficient. It wouldn't pass a code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, even though my coding skills are bad, they have made a huge impact in my life. I am more employable, more efficient, more valuable. I'm also happier, and &lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com/posts/third-option-success/"&gt;feel more optimistic about my future&lt;/a&gt;. Bad code works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been discouraged, I encourage you. It only takes a little bit --- enough to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--- Zed Shaw, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iwhe9n"&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How (What) To Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is the perfect language for bad coding by non-developers. You can do a lot without knowing very much, and there are a lot of tools for accomplishing non-development tasks --- writing tools, math tools, publishing tools, task automation tools. If you're going to learn to code in order to improve your own life (as opposed to learning to code to get a job or build things) Python is the best option. (It's also good for getting jobs and building things. Learning Python will not limit you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not recommend &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iwhe9n"&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is very popular. It's out of date and a bit too curmudgeonly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best book (I think) for learning to write Python for life-improvement is &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hGOZ6L"&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/enough-to-be-dangerous/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 14:31:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Enough to Be Dangerous: The Joy of Bad Python</title><link>http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/</link><dc:creator>Adam Michael Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to Code&lt;/strong&gt; is all the rage. I don't see any sign that the trend is dying down any time soon. I might as well jump on the bandwagon here and encourage my fellow tech writers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a lot of you already code, or are in the process of learning. I once assumed knowing at least some coding was a requirement for being a tech writer. But it seems this isn't entirely the case. Some TWs need to be able to read and write enough code to document APIs and provide code samples --- but apparently (I have learned) most tech writers aren't doing that, and you can fake your way through that if you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;if you are among the majority of technical writers that don't code, this post is for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Know Too Much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people outside the tech field suddenly decide that they are going to learn to code, they have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how hard that actually is. All of the "Learn to Code" resources, books, sites, and bootcamps tell you that you can learn to build web and mobile apps pretty easily --- in just a few weeks, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you first start coding, it seems magical. Especially if the framework does a lot for you. "Oh, wow! Is this all it takes to build an app?!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I know --- these people don't have any idea what they are in for, how difficult it is about to get for them, how far is the distance between local build and production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this stops many of us from getting started. It stopped me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beginner's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner's mind is a state in which, lacking the knowledge of how hard something is, everything seems easy. There are no boundaries, only possibilities. Beginner's mind is crucial for early learning of a new skill or subject area. With beginner's mind, small improvements seem like major wins.

&lt;p&gt;I am the master of my fate;&lt;br&gt;
I am the captain of my soul.&lt;br&gt;
— from &lt;em&gt;Invictus&lt;/em&gt;, by William Ernest Henley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong sense of agency --- the feeling that you can, indeed, control the course of your own life --- is an essential element of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a sense of agency can also be a source of crippling guilt and shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the master of my fate, then my lack of success up to this point is not my own fault. There is nothing wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;, well then --- I have some explaining to do. Why have I not lost the weight, started the business, written the book, built the app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with a history of lack of success, and trying to make it over the chasm of despair to a &lt;em&gt;designed life&lt;/em&gt;, we have these two explanations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world (fate, luck, God, the system, the Man, capitalism) has stopped me. Since the world hasn't changed, I will continue to not succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am responsible for my own fate. I have not succeeded so far, and that was my fault. Since I am clearly incapable of success, I will continue not to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a third option. We need a way to take hold of our own personal responsibility and sense of agency, without the guilt and shame that accompanies the recognition that we are responsible up to this point for our failures and lack of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I am in my early thirties. I've been trying to learn to play the piano for 15 years, trying lose weight for a decade, trying to become financially independent for eight years, trying to build my dream web app for six or seven, trying to learn to become a developer for five, trying to have a career as a writer for maybe two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine how many of those things I have accomplished. I've lost some weight and put it back on. I was pretty decent on piano for a while but I haven't played regularly in years. I am super bad at Ruby and Python, and only passable in PHP. I make a living as a writer, so there's that --- but I don't like the kind of writing I get paid to do. I've started building my dream web app (&lt;a href="http://hackwrite.com/posts/python-and-django-vs-ruby-and-rails/"&gt;in Django&lt;/a&gt;), but who knows whether that will work out the way I think. I don't even really want to talk about the money issue, but I can tell you that government-funded health "insurance" is going to pay for the birth of my second child in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My statements above about the two ways of understanding agency are not theoretical --- this is literally where I am at in my life. I have had, for a long time, a strong sense of agency. Justified or not, I feel that I am &lt;q&gt;the master of my fate, the captain of my soul.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can I effectively move forward? How can I shake off the guilt and regret of not having achieved very much at all up to this point, without giving up my sense that I am in control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a third option. We all need a third option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This needs a little work (you can help in the comments), but I think that third option is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;em&gt;am indeed&lt;/em&gt; the master of my fate. The world is indifferent, so I am responsible for my own success or failure. There was &lt;em&gt;some specific thing&lt;/em&gt; which I previously lacked, but was unaware of. Having become aware, I can move forward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that specific thing is a way of thinking about problems the way a developer thinks about problems. Learning to be a developer is (slowly) teaching me to develop myself. Even though I have been piddling around with PHP (and mostly WordPress) for four or five years, I have found that taking up Python development --- and also actually bothering to get good at the terminal, at git, at Linux, at setting up virtual environments, etc., etc., --- has changed the way I approach problems. I am further convinced that --- for me --- this different approach is what has been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, learning to be a developer (&lt;b&gt;n.b.&lt;/b&gt; not just a coder) is my third option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your third option?&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hackwrite.com/posts/third-option-success/third-option-success/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2016 15:26:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
